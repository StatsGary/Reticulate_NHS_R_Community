If you have any questions - please contact me via my website <a href="https://hutsons-hacks.info/">Hutson's Hacks</a>. 

Alternatively, you can contact me on my Twitter and Linkedin accounts. Details for these are also found on my website.

I hope you found this session informative, and for those Deep Learners out there, I would love to see if you can get better than 72% accuracy on the models. Please drop me a line and we can discuss how you did this.
